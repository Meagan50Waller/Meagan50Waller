## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a Go developer focused on building microservices using gRPC and Docker. This repository is a collection of projects and experiments that showcase my work in designing lightweight, scalable, and high-performance backend services using modern tools and best practices.

Go (Golang) offers the speed and simplicity that make it ideal for microservice architectures. Iâ€™m leveraging its strong concurrency model, type safety, and minimal runtime overhead to write clean, efficient code thatâ€™s easy to maintain and deploy. My focus is on writing services that are modular, loosely coupled, and optimized for performance in cloud-native environments.

For inter-service communication, Iâ€™m using gRPC, which allows for efficient, strongly typed remote procedure calls over HTTP/2. Through these projects, Iâ€™m learning how to define .proto files, generate Go code, and build robust service contracts between distributed components. Iâ€™m also exploring advanced concepts like streaming, middleware, and service reflection.

All services are containerized using Docker, which makes development, testing, and deployment more streamlined. Docker helps ensure consistency across environments, making it easier to scale and manage services as part of a larger system.

This repository includes working examples of microservices with gRPC endpoints, Docker configurations, and supporting code such as client libraries, API gateways, and service registries. Iâ€™m also exploring observability tools, CI/CD pipelines, and best practices for managing distributed systems.

If youâ€™re interested in Go, gRPC, or microservice architecture, feel free to explore the code, raise issues, or share feedback. Iâ€™m always looking to grow through open-source learning and connect with others building in this space.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to building fast, reliable services, one microservice at a time.
